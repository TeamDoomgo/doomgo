## Reporting a Vulnerability

When a vulnerability is found, please go to https://github.com/TeamDoomgo/doomgo/issues 
and create a new issue if it's not already created. In case that the vulnerability is high-level
(security risk or similar) you can contact us via E-mail at team@doomgo.cf or WhatsApp +1 (661) 271-0846.
After contacting us, we will review the code and search for the vulnerability, and in case that the
vulnerability was an important fixed point in the next update, it will appear in the "What's new" page
with the names of the people that noticed and notified it.

Because there is currently a small amount of developers working on this project, updates are not programmed
to anytime, so it may take a few time until a bug or vulnerability is fixed. Thanks for supporting us,
and for any issue that is not solved or you are not replied soon, contact us via E-mail at team@doomgo.cf or 
WhatsApp +1 (661) 271-0846.
